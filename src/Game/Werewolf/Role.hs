--   neither allegiance.

--   N.B., role equality is defined on just the 'tag' as a role's 'allegiance' may change throughout

-- | /Somehow forgotten with the coming of the Werewolves, the Witch has a chance to prove themself/

--
--   The Witch is called after the Werewolves. They are able to heal and poison one player per game.
--   There is no restriction on using both potions in one night or on healing themself.
