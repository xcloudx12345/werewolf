The Alpha Wolf leads the Werewolves in the raids against Ferns each night and not even the #{humanise seerRole} can see them coming. If the Werewolves caused the Villagers to question and accuse one another beforehand, the Alpha Wolf eliminates any shred of humanity left. No-one can be trusted anymore and no-one knows the truth.
